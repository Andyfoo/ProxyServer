How to compile?

This is a maven project. Go to the directory where the pom.xml file exists and use:

mvn clean install

to build the whole project.



How to run?

After you successfully build the project. There will be a .jar file under the target directory.
Use:

java -jar jar-file port_number

to run the proxy server program. Also you need to set up the correct proxy server in your browser.

I already include a pre-built jar file under the target directory.



Cache related

I include several cache mechanism for the proxy server like FIFOCache which use the first in
first out cache algorithm. Also I include a DiskCache which caches the http response on local
disk. For testing purpose, I also include a NullCache which means doesn't use cache at all. To
set up the cache mechanism for the proxy server, just use:

Cache cache = new FIFOCache(1000); // 1000 is cache capacity
ProxyServer proxyServer = new ProxyServer(port, cache);

If you want to use another cache mechanism just use:

Cache cache = new DiskCache(cacheRoot); // cacheRoot is the root directory to store the http
response
ProxyServer proxyServer = new ProxyServer(port, cache);
